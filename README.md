PROBLEM STATEMENT

In today's era, we have a lot of websites and portals for property purchase, sale, and rental. But for the people who want a home at cheap prices like students who usually find PGs if they shift for studies to other towns, where they find their homes?? Brokers take a lot of brokerages initially from house owners and students or other professionals looking for PGs who don't know whom to contact. So we came up with a solution to the problem "FindMyPG". Basically, We created a portal for PG owners and Finders to interact and help each other to find their perfect Guest homes. Owners can list their properties and can check queries from people about their PG and Students and Professionals in search of PGs can see all the available options right from their home and can enquire all about the PG without the interference of the middlemen. In short, no brokerage system and benefits on both sides.

CHALLENGES WHILE DEVELOPMENT

The challenge was not as such in this project. We were well-known about the technologies and since we both knew each other for a very long time so it was not a team challenge too. Me (Manav) was a beginner to Python and Django so understanding some points was a challenge sometimes for me but my teammate helped me a lot.
